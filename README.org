#+TITLE: download-shell

A simple wrapper around shells or shell scripts to provide outbound network access from a different IP address. Useful for contested networks, allowing blocking outbound network traffic from a host but still allowing a specific shell to continue operating on the system and accessing the internet

This program is meant to emulate the functionality provided by the [[./download-shell.sh][bash shell in the root directory]]
